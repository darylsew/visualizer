Visualizer
==========
Group members:
pd6: Eric Cerny, Hon Wei Khor
pd7: Daryl Sew, Peter Jasko

What we're going to do:
Take a music file and visualize it, let the user play around with some settings for the visualization.

How we're going to do it:
Good question. Working on that.

Resources:
last.fm API. maybe.
wave.py python library

We're not going to use the branch workflow until we agree on a workflow model (presumably in the next few days). For now, enjoy the proof of concept code.
